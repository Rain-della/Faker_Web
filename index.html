          I started my junior development in August 2022. My first programming
          language of choice was Python. Due to extensive research on the Python
          Programming language, i decided that it was the best option because it
          was the most beginner-friendly option. I used resources such as:

        <ul>
          <li>

              >Programiz.com</a
            >
          </li>

        </ul>
      </div>
      <p>
        Programiz.com was the most usefull of all in helping me learn the Python
        basics and programming in general. Once i became comfortable with Python
        i decided to learn a Python Library, and i library i chose to learn is
        pygame. I made a few demos with the library, teaching me the basics of
        pygame and Game development. I later got bored of Python and i decided
        to learn a language with a curly brace syntax. And so i chose
        JavaScript.I soon learnt the JavaScript syntax and basics, but for me to
        implement what i knew in JavaScript i needed to learn HTML.
